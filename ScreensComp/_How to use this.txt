In the 'ScreensComp' directory you must place the images that will be 
used by the script to compose the template with the BBCode 'Screenshot
Comparison'.

It is essential that the images have names that put the files in order:

source_01
encode_02

AvsPmod already does this automatically by including the frame as a suffix.
